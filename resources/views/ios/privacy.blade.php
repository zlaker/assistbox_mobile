                    This Privacy Policy explains how the Voxi Book Player application collects, uses, and protects information. By using the Application, you agree to the practices described below.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-8">1. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We collect a minimal amount of information to provide and improve our service. This information falls into two categories:</p>

                <h3 class="mt-6">a) Information Collected Automatically</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Device Identifier:</strong> For users who enable push notifications, we collect a non-personal, anonymized device identifier (such as an Apple Push Notification token or a similar Android identifier). This identifier is used solely to send you push notifications about new features and updates within the Voxi Book Player application. We cannot identify you personally from this token.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="mt-6">b) Information Collected with Your Explicit Consent</h3>
                <p>This data is collected only if you explicitly opt-in by checking the corresponding consent box within the Application's settings.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Listening History & Preferences:</strong> If you grant permission, the Application can locally save your in-app settings and create an archive of your listening history. This archive may include the names of audiobooks you have listened to, the total hours listened, and your progress (e.g., last playback position). This data is designed to be stored locally on your device to personalize your experience.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do not collect your name, email address, payment details, or any other personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily provide it (e.g., by contacting support).</p>

                <h2 class="mt-8">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>To send you push notifications about application updates and new features (based on your device identifier).</li>
                    <li>To save and restore your application preferences and listening progress across sessions (if you have opted-in).</li>
                    <li>To operate, maintain, and improve the Application.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="mt-8">3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your listening history and settings (collected with consent) are stored locally on your device. We do not upload, transmit, or store this data on our servers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Identifier:</strong> The anonymized device identifier for notifications is processed by our secure push notification service provider (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging for Android, Apple Push Notification service for iOS) and is not used for any other purpose.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We implement commercially acceptable security measures to protect the minimal information we handle. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-8">4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
                <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your information to third parties. We may share the anonymized device identifier strictly with our trusted push notification service provider to deliver updates, as described above.</p>
                <p>We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal obligations.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-8">5. Your Choices and Control</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> You can enable or disable push notifications at any time through your device's system settings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Listening History:</strong> You can revoke consent for storing your listening history and settings at any time by unchecking the opt-in box in the Application's settings. This will stop the collection of new data. To delete existing locally stored data, you can clear the Application's data via your device settings or uninstall the Application.</li>
                    <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> Since we do not collect personal information on our servers, there is no account-based opt-out process.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="mt-8">6. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Our Application is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with information, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-8">7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-8">8. Contact Us</h2>
